        <section><p>This is going to be a <i>long</i> ramble, so buckle up. Hello and welcome! My name is Aaron Wong, and I'm a lazy, no good hobbyist programmer who loves to spend his free time eating and sleeping. Feel free to address me as "The King of Norway" or "Lord Commissar of the Sacred Table," though my favorite title by far is <strong>"Moron."</strong> My hobbies include creating/editing xml and C# codes for whatever small project I happen to be working on at the time, playing copious amounts of video games, and being a general nuisance to my friends! Oh look this paragraph is getting long; I think this is good enough!</p></section>
